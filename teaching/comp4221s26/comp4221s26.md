# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

**COMP 4221, Spring 2026**  
**The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology**  
[**Yi R. (May) Fung**](https://mayrfung.github.io)

**Course description**: This course provides an introduction to the tasks, models and algorithms of natural language processing (NLP) including the fundamental NLP tasks and models (such as language model, text classification, word vectors, sequence labelling, etc.), and several typical NLP applications (such as question answering, dialogue systems and machine translation, etc.), and the linguistic structure annotation (such as constituency parsing and dependency parsing). The course also introduces some advanced topics such as pre-trained language models and their prompt tuning and instruct tuning methods to give the students more perspectives of the NLP
industry.

### Contact and Communication
[Canvas](https://canvas.ust.hk/courses/67721) is the main platform for communication about technical questions of lecture contents and homeworks. Please do not directly email the teaching staff on technical questions which may easily get lost. The teaching staff will try to answer questions on Canvas in a prompt manner. Some rules:

* All announcements and communications will happen over Canvas
* Please utilize the [Canvas Discussion](https://canvas.ust.hk/courses/67721/discussion_topics) page to ask questions. There are pre-existed discussion topics initiated by the staff such as lecture questions and each homework. Please post your questions in the respective thread, you are also encouraged to answer others' questions if you know the answer.
* While we allow students to optionally post anonymous questions and answers on Canvas, please do not post anything inappropriate as anonymous users -- in such cases, we will turn off the anonymous option.  
* If you have non-technical, private matters, please email the teaching staff directly.
* Please consult the [Course Logistics]() page before asking logistical questions.
* For longer discussions, please come to office hours.

### Prerequisites and Materials
Students are required to be familiar with probability and linear algebra, and able to program well in Python. 

This course does not have a textbook, but here are some helpful materials:
