# Machine Learning

**COMP 5212, Fall 2025**  
**The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology**  
[**Yi R. (May) Fung**](https://mayrfung.github.io)

**Course description**: this is an advanced machine learning course to provide a broad introduction to machine learning, covering foundational machine learning concepts, theory, algorithms, and applications. The topics include supervised learning (logistic regression, linear models, classification, SVM, kernal methods, naive Bayes), unsupervised learning (clustering, expectation maximization, graphical models, HMM), and reinforcement learning. It will include some optimization/learning topics (gradient descent, SGD, MLE and MAP estimation) as well. Certain aspects of deep learning are introducedï¼ˆneural network basics, architectures, VAEs, GANs). The last lectures will give a general introduction to techniques in large language models.

### Contact and Communication
[Canvas](https://canvas.ust.hk/courses/64686) is the main platform for communication about technical questions of lecture contents and homeworks. Please do not directly email the teaching staff on technical questions which may easily get lost. The teaching staff will try to answer questions on Canvas in a prompt manner. Some rules:

* All announcements and communications will happen over Canvas
* Please utilize the [Canvas Discussion](https://canvas.ust.hk/courses/64686/discussion_topics) page to ask questions. There are pre-existed discussion topics initiated by the staff such as lecture questions and each homework. Please post your questions in the respective thread, you are also encouraged to answer others' questions if you know the answer.
* While we allow students to optionally post anonymous questions and answers on Canvas, please do not post anything inappropriate as anonymous users -- in such cases, we will turn off the anonymous option.  
* If you have non-technical, private matters, please email the teaching staff directly.
* Please consult the [Course Logistics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZD6szBkgHbgsQWc-nzTNd8nb1KpJ2gbDeMukSjiuDVQ/edit?usp=sharing) page before asking logistical questions.
* For longer discussions, please come to office hours.

### Prerequisites and Materials
Students are required to be familiar with probability and linear algebra, and able to program well in Python. The [CMU 10701 self-assessment exam](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aarti/Class/10701_Spring23/Intro_ML_Self_Evaluation_new.pdf) is a good resource to roughly give you a notion of the background that is required for this course.

This course does not have a textbook, but here are some helpful materials:
